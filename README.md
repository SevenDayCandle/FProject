# FabUI

FabUI is a UI component library for SDL3 made to experiment with its upcoming SDL_GPU backend.

# Requirements

- C++ 23
- Only MSVC is supported as a build system at this time

The following libraries are used:
- SDL3: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
- Glaze: https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze

While this should work with Linux/Mac, I've only tested this with Windows
